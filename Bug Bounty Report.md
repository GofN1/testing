# Bug Bounty Report: Insufficient Access Control and Over-Reliance on Client-Side Controls

## Summary

This report outlines a security vulnerability discovered in `[Application/Website Name]`, where sensitive information meant for administrative eyes could be accessed without proper authentication. This issue arises from an undue reliance on client-side controls coupled with inadequate server-side access validation.

## Description of Vulnerability

### Discovery and Impact

While exploring `[Application/Website Name]`, a warning pop-up that seemingly restricted access to certain parts of the website was bypassed. By utilizing the browser's developer tools, I was able to remove the `<div>` element generating the warning, thereby revealing information that seemed to be intended for administrative access only.

This exposes two significant security concerns:
1. **Insufficient Access Controls:** The application does not adequately enforce access controls on the server side, relying on client-side elements to restrict access instead.
2. **Over-reliance on Client-Side Controls:** Security measures are based on the client's browser, which can be manipulated by any user or potential attacker.

The exposure of sensitive or administrative information to unauthorized users can lead to unauthorized actions, data leaks, and other security risks.

### Technical Details

- **Vulnerability Type:** Broken Access Control
- **Impact:** Medium to High (dependent on the nature of the exposed information)
- **Location:** [Specific page/feature where the vulnerability was found]
- **Reproduction Steps:**
  1. Visit [specific page/feature].
  2. When faced with the warning pop-up, right-click and choose "Inspect" to open developer tools.
  3. Find and delete the `<div>` element associated with the warning.
  4. Notice that sensitive administrative information is now visible without authentication.

## Recommended Mitigations

Addressing this vulnerability requires the implementation of robust access controls on the server side. Recommendations include:

1. **Server-Side Validation:** Ensure all sensitive information and administrative functionalities are guarded by server-side authentication and authorization checks.
2. **Minimize Client-Side Controls:** Employ client-side controls for enhancing user experience rather than security enforcement.
3. **Regular Security Audits:** Perform detailed security reviews and audits to identify and rectify vulnerabilities related to access control and client-side manipulations.

## Conclusion

Identifying this vulnerability underscores the necessity for stringent, server-side security protocols to prevent unauthorized data access. By adopting the recommended security measures, `[Application/Website Name]` can significantly improve its defense against data breaches and unauthorized access.
